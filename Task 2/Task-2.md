## VISION TASKPHASE Task-2
# Python Libraries.
## 1) NumPy
NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a Python library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations and much more.
## 2) Pandas
Pandas is an open-source library that is built on top of NumPy library. It is a Python package that offers various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series. It is mainly popular for importing and analyzing data much easier.The package provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data in the easy way.It is mainly used for the real world data analysis in Python. It is a flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.
## 3) Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a low level library in python for data visualization. Matplotlib.pyplot is a plotting library used for making 2D plots from data in arrays. It  is written in Python and makes use of NumPy.
## 4) Scikit-Learn
This a Python library especially used to implement the Machine Learning algorithms and is built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib, this library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
## 5) Open CV
*OpenCV* is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
